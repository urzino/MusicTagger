# MusicTagger
Multiclass, multilabel tagging of music tracks, using Keras and 3 different approaches: 2D CNNs on the Mel spectrogram and 1D CNNs on the raw waveform, replicating results in the literature with minor tweaks, and a novel approach using RNNs, almost matching the state of the art. Networks trained on Microsoft Azure machines. Assignment for the Deep Learning course, 2017-2018.
